  <p>Checkout <a href="https://venturecost.com/trip/10812/canggu-bali-indonesia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Venture Cost</a> for more detailed breakdown of my expenses. The figures are slightly different because I forgot to include several large expenses (gym and coworking for Hannah) but Venture Cost doesn't allow me to update the figures after submitting my trip...

  <h2>About the city's quirks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Canggu is a nice spot to learn surfing. It will cost you only 50k (around £2.5)</li>
    <li>you could get a coconut for £1.5 on the beach and watch the sunset</li>
    <li>you can get wi-fi in most cafés and restaurants - we didn't get a SIM card throughout our stay</li>
    <li>delivery from any restaurant costs you on average 70p</li>
    <li>the co-working space (dojo) is open 24 hours, 7 days a week</li>
    <li>bintang is pretty much your only choice of beer - it will cost you around £2 per bottle.</li>
    <li>the beach club is a great place if you want to dance on the sand</li>
    <li>sunsets in Canggu are the best ones I've seen</li>
    <li>smoothie bowls are everywhere and they are a great choice for breakfast</li>
    <li>scooters are the main mode of transport - you won't see a lot of people walking</li>
    <li>gojeks are really cheap and can get you almost anywhere - except some tourists hotspots where the local community can get quite angry if they see an online service.</li>
    <li>great international community, but tourists/expats and locals are quite separated - we found ourselves to be in a "bubble"</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>About the city</h2>
  <p>It's safe to say that Canggu didn't have a clue that it would become so popular - I was told by expats that 5 years ago, the town was mainly rice paddies and a bunch of Australian surfers.</p>
  <div class="photo-grid">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/travel/canggu/canggu2.jpg">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/travel/canggu/canggu3.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>The town is buzzing with construction work which can be quite annoying if you are trying to work or sleep.</p>
  <p>Because of the quick increase of population and tourism, Canggu lacks the infrastructure that a bigger town would have - there are a lot of stray dogs, pollution and lack of traffic laws.</p>
  <p>We didn't want to rent a bike as we heard that it can be dangerous so we walked/gojeked everywhere for the first month. After one month of doing this, we decided to rent a bike and our lives got a lot easier!</p>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/travel/canggu/bike.jpg">
  <p>Finally, the beach - one of Canggu's biggest selling points! It offers a great opportunity to learn how to surf and watch sunsets while drinking a beer or a coconut.</p>

  <h2>About our place</h2>
  <p>We decided to stay in a <a href="www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/15835458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guest house</a> instead of having a place on our own. We had an ensuite room in a 8 room house and shared the common area (the pool) with the other guests.</p>
  <p>The guest house had daily housekeeping, so the place was clean and tidy. Since water is not drinkable in Bali, it was also nice that we had a water fountain near our room.</p>

<div>
  <h2>About work spots</h2>
  <p>Dojo was our place of choice throughout our stay in Canggu. It is a renovated villa and currently it's one of the most popular co-working spaces in Bali (and the world?). An unlimited monthly membership will cost you around <mark>£160 per month</mark>, but they also have other pricing models to fit your situation.</p>
  <p>The co-working space is open 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, so it is great for remote workers and workaholics like me. It also has a wide range of social activities and events. The monthly community barbeque night is great!</p>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/travel/canggu/work1.jpg">
  <p>Besides that, we also visited plenty of coffee shops which offer cheap coffee and good internet. Our favourite one was <mark>Essential Canggu</mark> - great place, tasty food & drinks and the people who run it are amazing.</p>

<div>
  <h2>About the food</h2>
  <p>Our accomodation didn't have a kitchen, so we ate out... for every meal. If you are in Canggu, you shouldn't expect to cook. First of all, groceries are limited in quantity and quality (as you can see from our grocery expenses) and they are often more expensive than eating out.</p>
  <p>No worries - the area where Canggu excels is with the food selection & quality. You can find great food, which looks and tastes great (and it's affortable as well).</p>
  <p>You can get lunch or dinner for about £3-5. You can easily spend more if you want to - on plenty of occasions, our bill was around £10 per meal.</p>
  <div class="photo-grid">

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/travel/canggu/food4.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>The types of food that you can find in Canggu includes (but definitely not limited) smoothie bowls, noodles & rice meals (indonesian noodle food is great - my favourite is <mark>mie goreng</mark>), pizza, burgers, mexican, salads and a lot of avocado toasts.</p>
  <p>We also had lots of fresh coconuts.</p>

  <h2>About the stuff we did</h2>
  <p>For the first time in my life, I surfed - love it! There are not any photos of me actually surfing, but here is one of a dog and my surfboard.</p>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/travel/canggu/surfing1.jpg">
  <p>I was also introduced to yoga

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/travel/canggu/yoga2.jpg">

  <p>We went to a beach bar/club with a swimming pool and then drank beers on the beach with friends in front of a fire</p>

  <p>Our friends from America invided us over for breakfast</p>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/travel/canggu/activity3.jpg">
  <p>We went out with dojo friends for many meals and drinks</p>

  <p>We went to Ubud for the weekend</p>

  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/travel/canggu/ubud2.jpg">
  <p>We also visited the Gilli Islands for 2 nights, which was one of our favourite places during our stay. The island is really chill, the water is clean and the people are friendly! One of the craziest things is that you can walk around the circumference of the island in about 1:30 hours.</p>

  <p>During our last weekend in Bali, we visited the floating temple - it is around 25 minutes away from Canggu - the longest bike journey I did!</p>

  <h2>About my productivity</h2>
  <p>My time in Canggu was mainly focused on my full-time job where we launched a  <a href="https://wearewildgoose.com/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new marketing website</a>.</p>
  <p>At my freelance gig, I continued working with my client pushing more features and improvements to both the client and business websites.</p>
  <p>I also bought the <a href="https://www.microacquisitions.com/how-to-buy-small-companies/wewen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">micro acquisitions course</a> (affiliate link) which introduced me to the world of buying and selling small companies. I hope to do exactly that in 2020, even on a small scale.</p>

  <h2>How we scored the city</h2>
  <svg class="line-chart"></svg>
  <p>A few notes on the scoring:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Safety - the main reason why safety was so low is that there were a lot of stray dogs on the street which could bite you. Also, sometimes there are drunk tourists riding bikes. Otherwise, the locals were nothing but friendly and welcoming!</li>
    <li>Cleanliness - restaurants, bars & accommodation were really clean - what wasn't were the streets and beaches. A lot of trash laying around didn't make walking on the streets a pleasant experience.</li>
    <li>Walkability - even though most things in Canggu were about 15-20 minutes away from each other, walking proved a challenge - there are no walking paths.</li>
    <li>Culture - unlike other places, I was not able to learn a lot about the local's culture because I felt there was a separation between local culture and tourist culture. So, as a tourist, a lot of Canggu's culture is the tourist's culture.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>About what's next</h2>
  <p>After short stops in Bangkok and Ireland, we will head to London where we will stay over the next 2 months. Neither of us have ever lived there, so I want to see what it's like.</p>
  <p>I don't have high expectations for the city, but let's see if it can surprise me!</p>
