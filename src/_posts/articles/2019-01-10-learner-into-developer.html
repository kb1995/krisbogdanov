  <h2>Short history of me in the learning cycle</h2>
  <p>In highschool, I studied an <mark>introductory computing subject for one year</mark>. I hated it! Studying all of this CS high-level theory stuff was not what I was expecting from programming.</p>
  <p>I <b>dropped it</b> at the end of the year. Decided to go into the maths/finance route instead.</p>
  <p>Forward to mid 2017, I was in my 3rd year of my Maths degree, but I wanted to give coding another chance. However, I had no idea where to start from.</p>
  <p>So I decided to start from <b>everywhere</b>. ü§∑</p>
  <p>6 months in, I started reading books and watching online courses on <b>Visual Studio, Android, Java, PHP, SQL, algorithms, WordPress development, Python and PyGame</b> (because why not create games in Python?? üë®‚Äçüé§).</p>
  <p>Damn, I had no idea what I was supposed to do. I was spending all my free time studying programming, but <b>I was not becoming a programmer</b>.</p>
  <p>Stuff had to change quickly, because summer internship applications were already open.</p>

  <h2>Define your goal</h2>

  <p>Do you want to</p>
  <ul>
    <li>change careers?</li>
    <li>get your first software developer internship?</li>
    <li>become an indie maker?</li>
    <li>code as a hobby?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Define why you want to code. Once you know <b>how important coding is for your future</b>, then you can decide how many hours per day/week you should dedicate on becoming a software developer.</p> 
  <p>I decided that this is the career I want to follow. My first step would be to get a summer internship in web development. So over the next months, I had to spend hours upon hours applying to internships and learning how to code. üë®üèº‚Äçüíª</p>
  <p>It wasn't time to learn all programming languages and all CS theory behind it - instead, <b>I had to become hireable.</b></p>

  <h2>Follow people who are already there</h2>

  <p>Start following people who are already where you want to be. Twitter, YouTube and Reddit are great places for this, where plenty of people can give you a daily dose of solid advice and motivation. Helps you keep going daily.</p>
  <p><b>I am still the new kid on the block, but you can <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}" target="_blank">follow me on Twitter</a> - I document my journey of being a self-taught full-stack developer and give advice to people who want to get there.</b></p>
  <p>In addition, you can check your local tech meet up groups. There are plenty of developers who will be more than glad to answer your questions.</p>

  <h2>Pick a stack and stick to it (for now at least)</h2>
  
  <p>If you want to be a front-end developer, focus on the things that will make you a front-end developer - HTML, CSS, React, design.</p>
  <p>If you want to be a mobile developer, focus on react-native or Swift/Android.</p>
  <p>Huge shortcut to making the transition from learner to developer is not wasting time on things you will not use in the near future.</p>
  <p>Remember all the languages I listed above? I spent months on courses and books, but now I remember <b>nothing</b> from them.</p>
  <p>In early 2018, I decided to focus on Javascript and ReactJS - they were fairly easy to start with and provided an opportunity to build exciting stuff that I can show to people.</p>
  <p><b>Focus on the things that matter.</b></p>
  <p>Make peace with yourself that it is ok not to know everything. Dan Abramov, the co-creator of create-react-app and the creator of Redux, <a href="https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/" target="_blank">doesn't know bunch of things</a>. And he is perfectly fine with that.</p>

  <h2>It's time to leave tutorial paradise</h2>

  <p>Tutorials are great in the beginning, but at some point <b>they become counterproductive</b>.</p>
  <p>So many times I find a tutorial for an awesome project, I start watching it, but halfway through, I realise that I have just been copy-pasting from the video without actually learning anything.</p>
  <p>In my opinion, that's not the biggest problem about tutorials. There is <b>no danger in tutorials</b> - they are perfect examples, where nothing can go wrong.</p>
  <p><b>95% of development is problem solving.</b> On a daily basis, you are presented with problems you don't know the answer of. You need to figure solution out by yourself, or by Googling.</p>
  <p>Tutorials are great for learning the basics of new language/framework or when you are stuck on a problem, but they will only get you so far. In order to go beyond tutorials, you need to start building projects.</p>

  <h2>Coding is making things</h2>

  <p>Once I started making things, I found watching tutorials just for the sake of watching tutorials boring and pointless.</p>
  <p>Creating projects is the <b>catalyst to becoming a developer</b>. And once you are a developer, it's still an instrument that keeps the passion going.</p>
  <p>My view on development changed once I started working on my small projects. All of the sudden, I wasn't following someone's tutorial - instead, I was on my own, making decisions on every single line of code and solving every little puzzle along the way.</p>
  <p>In the months leading to me getting my first software developer internship, I was <a href="https://www.kris.ventures/personal-projects-before-first-internship/" target="_blank">making projects all the time</a>. Even though they were basic projects, I still got the thrill of figuring out every problem thrown at me.</p>
  <p><b>Code, bug, Google, fix, repeat.</b> Personal projects are the best simulator to what it's like being a full-time developer as well as teaching you extremely valuable skills.</p>
