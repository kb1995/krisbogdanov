  <h2>Apply and make at the same time</h2>
  <p>Companies love personal projects! Show them the work you have done.</p>
  <p>Personal projects indicate good self-motivation and self-management. They also help employers with assessing your current skill level and coding style.</p>

  <h2>Language/Framework choice doesn't matter</h2>
  <p>It doesn't matter which language or framework you choose to start with. All of them do the same thing - <b>they help you build stuff</b>.</p>
  <p>I started making front-end web apps, because it was so much easier to get started compared to back-end/mobile. All of the projects below are done in <b>ReactJS</b> - I loved the concept of components and Jquery was just too confusing.</p>

  <h2>Projects shouldn't be huge (or perfect)</h2>
  <p>Remember - your projects should be able to accomplish their main goal. It should be in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">MVP stage</a>.</p>
  <p>As you will see in a minute, my first projects were</p>
  <ul>
    <li>simple</li>
    <li>full of bugs</li>
    <li>90s design</li>
    <li>not responsive</li>
  </ul>
  <p>But they did the main thing they were created for.</p>
  <p>Employers don't expect big, perfect projects - they want to see commitment to learning.</p>
  <p>Therefore, make sure to hit the MVP stage, put it in your resume and move to another project. You can always update later. <a href="https://jurn.blog/fuck-it-ship-it/" target="_blank">Perfectionism is your enemy.</a></p>
  <p><b>I regularly tweet about my current and future personal projects, so <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}" target="_blank">follow me</a> to keep up to date with my progress.</b></p>

  </div>
  <p>My first ever project with ReactJS. And just like all other first projects, it is a todo list app.</p>
  <p>I learnt the basics of ReactJS, state management and some CSS. Useful stuff for later projects!</p>

  <p>First time I have ever used an API - very valuable project.</p>
  <p>Notice that if you put a wrong city name, it errors out. I didn't know how to fix it at the time. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

  <h2>Wikipedia Search</h2>

  </div>
  <p>This project used the Wikipedia API. Since I already knew the basics of APIs, I was able to build it a lot faster.</p>
  <p>I was already getting comfortable with conditional formatting and thinking about components.</p>

  <p>By far, this is my favourite personal project from the ones listed here.</p>
  <p>Train a machine with your own inputs, so it can show the right text color based on a colored background.</p>

  <p>How cool is that?? üé®</p>
  <p>I got inspired after watching a video about a neural network library. The ability to train it yourself added that extra interactivity that people loved.</p>

  <p>I was making this in the weeks leading up to me getting the internship, but I was still gonna send it.</p>
  <img style="width: 250px" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/personal-projects-before-internship/send-it.gif">
  <p>Looking at the previous projects, there is no surprise that the design is bad. However, it illustrated some new skills in React that I didn't know previously - react router and styled components.</p>

  <h2>Got the internship!</h2>
  <p>After 6 months of non-stop job applications and learning web development, I got my best case scenario internship - <a href="https://airbyte.uk/" target="_blank">Airbyte</a>!</p>
  <p>When I got the internship offer, I had 5 other interviews scheduled up over the next 2 weeks. This was after months of email rejections.</p>
  <p>Looking back, the main difference was the personal projects and the knowledge gained from them.</p>
  <p>Go and start making things!</p>
